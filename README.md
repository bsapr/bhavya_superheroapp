Hi,

Please find the app entailing three pages. First page has dyanamic search button which provides the functionality of dynamic search. API is getting triggered on keypress event in order to implement its dynamic functionality.

On clicking superhero card(image), it will land you to specific superhero profile and it provies you a lot of details of superhero. I am maintaining id of seleted superhero in local storage which I retrive in script of profile page so that I can hit API for particular selected superhero.

There is also a favourite button which you can select and in return, it saves the name and url in localstorage so that we can showcase the list of your favourite superhereos and it remain persists in memory.
